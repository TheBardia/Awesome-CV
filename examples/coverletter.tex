\begin{cvletter}

  \begin{letterbodyen}
    Dear Hiring Manager,
    
    % \lettersection{About Me}
    % As a young and motivated Computer Security graduate, I am very interested in architecting, designing and developing software that is robust and secure. Thus, I have been focusing on securing software using best security practices. While working in Scotiabank, I have designed and developed a cryptography tool specifically for the Information Security and Control department. Along the path, I have found my passion for crafting software and computer security details. I believe my strength is in being genuinely eager about knowing why something happened and planning to solve problems fundamentally.

    % \lettersection{Why Google?}
    % Recently, I co-founded an automotive service company and managed to develop a mini ERP and a PWA. My team members will continue with the project. I am, therefore, looking for a full-time position to transition from my current role. Crafting a security tool or architecting secure software both require a combination of computer security knowledge and software development skills. Thus, I think I can be a good fit for the \putposition role in the software team at \putcompanyname.

    % \lettersection{Why Me?}
    % I am looking to work with a diverse group of talented professionals to architect, design and develop software that can help make tomorrow better for your customers and my team members while improving my skills and growing in my career. Please review my resume since I believe that my motivation, commitment, and current skills will allow me to fit into your work environment and start supporting \putcompanyname.

    % Working on the most cutting edge technologies to change and improve how we interact with information, and one another has always been my passion. I look forward to meeting with you and other members of the software team to discuss my suitability for this position further. I can be contacted at \putmobile.
  
    Many firms develop or integrate new software, and some claim to do it fast. However, it's not just about implementing technology; it's about working smarter and faster to drive results. That's why InsurCloud is novel and effective. Other than technology insight, \putcompanyname \ promises to combine in-depth industry knowledge, proprietary methods and process experience to every project to focus on value and drive results.

    While studying Computer Security, I have passionately focused on developing and architecting software, specifically with Microservices architecture and RESTful APIs. Last year, I co-founded Tread2Go, an automotive service company and managed to architect and develop a highly available and scalable ERP. As a marketplace, Tread2Go connects drivers to local technicians for remote automobile services. By leveraging technology, Tread2Go avoids tedious and time-consuming traditional approaches to help its customers save time and money while bringing convenience and simplicity. In the last five years, I have always been working directly with key stakeholders, and at Tread2Go, I was fully responsible for onsite customer support and 24/7 technical support.
    
    \putcompanyname's innovations in the market, and my conversations with \putcompanyname \ professionals, namely Mashruf Chowdhury and Marmara El Masri, have introduced a rich environment filled with dedicated team members and a vision to deliver excellence in solving clients' problems. \putcompanyname's values strongly resonate with me, and I feel that I can both contribute to and learn from such an environment.
    
    Architecting secure software and consulting the best solutions to customers require a combination of software development, computer security, and strong interpersonal expertise. Thus, I think I can be a good fit for the \putposition role in the Asset Factory team at \putcompanyname. I am interested in this opportunity as I believe it will enable me to use my passion and skills to make a difference and allow clients to drive business results.

    I genuinely appreciate your time and consideration.
