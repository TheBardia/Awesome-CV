\begin{cvletter}

  \begin{letterbodyen}
    Dear Brian Jackson,
    
    % \lettersection{About Me}
    As a young and motivated Computer Security graduate, I am very interested in architecting, designing and developing software that is robust and secure. Thus, I have been focusing on securing software using best security practices. While previously working in \putcompanyname, I have designed and developed a cryptography tool specifically for the Information Security and Control department. Mr. Gustavo Castro has kindly mentored me and guided me to shape my career, and along the path, I have found my passion for crafting software and computer security details.

    While studying Computer Security, I have passionately focused on developing and architecting software, specifically with Microservices architecture and RESTful APIs. Last year, I co-founded Tread2Go, an automotive service company and managed to architect and develop a highly available and scalable ERP and a PWA.

    As a marketplace, Tread2Go connects drivers to local technicians for remote automobile services. By leveraging technology, Tread2Go avoids tedious and time-consuming traditional approaches to help its customers save time and money while bringing convenience and simplicity. In the last five years, I have always been working directly with key stakeholders, and at Tread2Go, I was fully responsible for onsite customer support and 24/7 technical support.

    Architecting secure software and crafting security tools require a combination of software development and computer security expertise. Thus, I think I can be a good fit for the \importantstyle{Full Stack Engineer} or \importantstyle{Backend (Java) Developer} roles in the \importantstyle{Digital Factory} team at \putcompanyname. My motivation, commitment, and current skills will allow me to elaborate requirements, architect and implement new software components and features for different projects at \importantstyle{Digital Factory}. I am interested in this opportunity as I believe it will enable me to use my passion and skills to make a difference and allow clients to drive enhanced results.

    I genuinely appreciate your time and consideration.
  \end{letterbodyen}
